A quiz app is a mobile application or web-based platform designed to provide users with an interactive
experience of testing their knowledge on various subjects through a series of questions. 
These questions can cover a wide range of topics such as general knowledge, trivia, history, science,
pop culture, and more. Users typically answer multiple-choice or true/false questions within a
specified time limit.
Quiz apps often include features such as leaderboards to track high scores, different levels of difficulty, 
the ability to challenge friends or other users, and sometimes even rewards or incentives for participation. 
They offer a fun and engaging way for users to learn new information, compete with others, and test
their skills and knowledge in a gamified environment.
